# Story 3.5: Conversation Insights with AI Analysis

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As a** support manager,  
**I want** automated AI-powered analysis of completed conversations to provide insights on customer sentiment, issue patterns, and resolution effectiveness,  
**so that** I can improve support quality, identify training needs, and optimize our bot performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Background job processes completed conversations using Hangfire to generate insights without impacting UI performance
2. OpenAI GPT models analyze conversation content to extract sentiment, themes, resolution success, and improvement suggestions
3. Generated insights are stored in the database and linked to specific conversations for historical tracking
4. Conversation detail page displays insights in an organized, readable format using MudBlazor components with tabs or expansion panels
5. Insights include conversation sentiment, key topics discussed, issue resolution assessment, and actionable recommendations
6. Only conversations in "Completed" status are processed for analysis to ensure complete conversation context
7. Background job handles failures gracefully with retry mechanisms and proper error logging

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From completed conversation management stories:
- Conversation entities and database structure are fully established [Source: src/Domain/Entities/Conversation.cs]
- CQRS patterns with `IApplicationDbContextFactory` are operational [Source: previous story implementations]
- Hangfire background job infrastructure is configured and working [Source: src/Server.UI/DependencyInjection.cs]
- SignalR real-time updates are available for conversation changes [Source: existing conversation features]
- Conversation detail pages already exist with tab-based layout patterns [Source: existing conversation UI]

### Data Models

**New ConversationInsight Entity**:
- **ConversationInsight.Id**: Guid primary identifier
- **ConversationInsight.ConversationId**: Guid foreign key to parent conversation
- **ConversationInsight.SentimentScore**: decimal - Overall conversation sentiment (-1.0 to 1.0)
- **ConversationInsight.SentimentLabel**: string - Human readable sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)  
- **ConversationInsight.KeyThemes**: string - JSON array of extracted themes and topics
- **ConversationInsight.ResolutionSuccess**: bool? - Whether issue was resolved successfully
- **ConversationInsight.CustomerSatisfactionIndicators**: string - JSON array of satisfaction signals
- **ConversationInsight.Recommendations**: string - JSON array of improvement suggestions
- **ConversationInsight.ProcessingModel**: string - GPT model used for analysis (e.g., "gpt-4")
- **ConversationInsight.ProcessedAt**: DateTime - When analysis was completed
- **ConversationInsight.ProcessingDuration**: TimeSpan - How long analysis took
- **ConversationInsight.TenantId**: Guid - Multi-tenant isolation

**Existing Conversation Entity Extensions**:
- **Conversation.HasInsights**: computed property to check if insights exist
- **Conversation.InsightGeneratedAt**: DateTime? for tracking analysis completion

### API Specifications

**Azure OpenAI Integration**:
- Use existing Azure OpenAI service configuration from project [Source: existing bot integration]
- Implement structured prompts for consistent analysis output
- Handle token limits by chunking long conversations appropriately
- Use GPT-4 for higher quality analysis when available, fallback to GPT-3.5

**CQRS Command Pattern**:
- **CreateConversationInsightCommand**: Inherits from `ICacheInvalidatorRequest<Result<Guid>>`
- **GetConversationInsightsQuery**: Inherits from `ICacheableRequest<Result<ConversationInsightDto>>`
- Follow established Result<T> pattern for error handling [Source: existing CQRS implementations]

**Hangfire Background Job Pattern**:
- Use `IBackgroundJobClient` for job scheduling [Source: existing Hangfire setup]
- Implement `IHangfireJob` interface for consistent job structure
- Configure retry policies and failure handling in job registration

### Component Specifications

**Blazor Detail Page Integration**:
```razor
@inject IMediator Mediator
@inject ISnackbar Snackbar
@inject IStringLocalizer<ConversationInsights> L
```
[Source: existing conversation UI patterns]

**MudBlazor Components for Insights Display**:
- Use `MudTabs` for organizing insights sections (Overview, Themes, Recommendations)
- Use `MudChip` with color coding for sentiment indicators
- Use `MudExpansionPanels` for collapsible recommendation sections
- Use `MudProgressCircular` for loading states during analysis
- Use `MudAlert` for displaying analysis status and errors

**Real-time Updates**:
- Extend existing SignalR hub to broadcast when insights are completed
- Update conversation detail pages automatically when analysis finishes
- Use connection groups to target specific conversation viewers

### Technical Constraints

**Database Access Pattern (CRITICAL)**:
- **ALWAYS use `IApplicationDbContextFactory` for database access in background jobs** [Source: established pattern]
- Use `await using var db = await _dbContextFactory.CreateAsync(ct);` in jobs [Source: coding standards]
- Ensure proper disposal and connection management in long-running jobs

**Multi-Tenant Isolation (CRITICAL)**:
- All ConversationInsight queries must include tenant filtering [Source: established tenant patterns]
- Background jobs must process conversations per tenant to maintain isolation
- Use tenant-aware job scheduling to prevent cross-tenant data leaks

**AI Service Integration**:
- Implement proper retry policies for OpenAI API failures [Source: existing bot service patterns]
- Add rate limiting to respect OpenAI API quotas and costs
- Use structured prompts with consistent JSON output format for parsing
- Implement token counting and conversation chunking for large conversations

**Background Job Best Practices**:
- Jobs should be idempotent to handle duplicate executions safely
- Implement proper cancellation token support for graceful shutdowns
- Use exponential backoff for retries with maximum attempt limits
- Add comprehensive logging at INFO level for job execution tracking

### Performance Considerations

**AI Processing Optimization**:
- Process conversations in batches to optimize API usage
- Cache analysis results to avoid reprocessing unchanged conversations
- Implement queue-based processing to handle high volumes
- Consider async processing with progress indicators for large backlogs

**Database Query Efficiency**:
- Use efficient queries to identify unprocessed completed conversations
- Index ConversationId in ConversationInsights for fast lookups
- Use `ProjectTo<ConversationInsightDto>()` for efficient data mapping
- Implement pagination for large result sets in queries

**UI Performance**:
- Load insights asynchronously to avoid blocking conversation detail display
- Implement progressive loading for insights sections
- Cache insights data in component state to minimize re-fetching
- Use skeleton loading states while insights are being retrieved

### Architecture Alignment

**Clean Architecture Compliance**:
- AI analysis service belongs in Infrastructure layer as external service
- Business logic for insight validation and processing in Application layer
- UI components only interact with Application layer via MediatR
- Domain entities contain only business rules, no external dependencies

**Hangfire Integration**:
- Background jobs are Infrastructure layer concerns
- Jobs use Application layer services through dependency injection
- Job scheduling and management through Infrastructure layer only
- No direct UI interaction with background job infrastructure
