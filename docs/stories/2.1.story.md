### API Specifications
**CQRS Query Pattern**:
- **GetIssuesQuery**: Inherits from `ICacheableRequest<Result<PaginatedList<IssueListDto>>>` for caching support [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Query Parameters**: Page, PageSize, SearchTerm, StatusFilter, PriorityFilter, CategoryFilter, AssignedUserFilter, DateRangeStart, DateRangeEnd, SortBy, SortDirection
- **Return Pattern**: `Result<PaginatedList<IssueListDto>>` with success/failure status [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#api-error-handling]

**SignalR Hub Methods**:

- `IssueCreated(IssueListDto issue)` - Broadcast new issues to dashboard users [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- `IssueStatusChanged(Guid issueId, IssueStatus newStatus)` - Broadcast status changes [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Component Specifications
**Blazor Dashboard Page Template**:
```razor
@page "/issues"
@attribute [Authorize(Policy = Permissions.Issues.View)]
@inject IMediator Mediator
@inject ISnackbar Snackbar
@inject IDialogService DialogService
@inject IPermissionService PermissionService
@inject IStringLocalizer<Issues> L
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@implements IAsyncDisposable
```
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

**MudBlazor Data Table Integration**:
- Use `MudDataGrid<IssueListDto>` with server-side data loading [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Implement `ServerData` delegate for query execution [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Configure sortable columns with `SortBy` property [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Add filtering controls using `MudSelect`, `MudDateRangePicker`, `MudTextField` [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]

### Technical Constraints
**Database Access Pattern (CRITICAL)**:
- **ALWAYS use `IApplicationDbContextFactory` for database access** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]
- Use `await using var db = await _dbContextFactory.CreateAsync(ct);` pattern [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]

**Multi-Tenant Isolation (CRITICAL)**:
- All Issue queries must include tenant filtering via `ITenantService` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]
- Use `ITenantService.GetCurrentTenant()` for automatic tenant context [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]
- Never write queries without tenant filtering [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]

**Blazor Component State Management**:
- Use `[Parameter]` for parent-child component communication [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#blazor-component-state]
- Use scoped services for cross-component state sharing [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#blazor-component-state]
- Implement `IAsyncDisposable` for SignalR connection cleanup [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Permission Checks**:
- Use `[Authorize(Policy = Permissions.Issues.View)]` on page level [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]
- Check permissions in components with `IPermissionService.HasPermissionAsync` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]

**SignalR Real-Time Updates**:
- Initialize SignalR connection in `OnInitializedAsync()` [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use `HubConnectionBuilder` with proper error handling [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Implement connection state management and reconnection logic [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Performance Considerations
**Database Query Optimization**:
- Use `ProjectTo<IssueListDto>()` for efficient data mapping [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Implement proper indexes on filtering columns [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]
- Use server-side pagination to limit data transfer [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**SignalR Performance**:
- Use connection groups for targeted updates [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Implement debouncing for search input to reduce query load [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Architecture Alignment
**Clean Architecture Compliance**:
- UI layer communicates with Application layer via MediatR only [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Query handlers implement business logic and data access patterns [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Domain entities remain pure without UI dependencies [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**MudBlazor Integration**:
- Use Material Design principles for consistent UI [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Leverage built-in accessibility features [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Follow MudBlazor theming and customization patterns [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
