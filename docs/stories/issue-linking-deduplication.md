# Issue Linking and Deduplication

**Status**: In Development  
**Story ID**: issue-linking-deduplication  
**Epic**: Issue Management Enhancement  
**Assigned Agent**: dev  
**Agent Model Used**: claude-sonnet-4-20250514  

## Story
Implement intelligent issue linking and deduplication capabilities that automatically detect similar issues when logged through the bot, notify users of existing similar issues, link related issues together, and provide UI for managing these relationships.

## Key Requirements
- **Similarity Detection**: When an issue is logged via bot, check for similar issues within a configurable timeframe
- **Bot Response Enhancement**: If similar issue found, respond to user indicating awareness and investigation status
- **Issue Linking**: Automatically link the new issue to the existing similar issue as a related/duplicate
- **Impact Tracking**: Show all linked issues with user details and their specific descriptions
- **Manual Management**: UI to view, link, and unlink related issues
- **Bulk Resolution**: When parent issue is resolved, notify all linked issue reporters

## Business Value
- Reduce duplicate issue investigation effort
- Improve user communication about known issues  
- Better understanding of issue impact and affected user base
- Streamlined resolution notifications for widespread issues

## Technical Approach

### Database Design
```sql
CREATE TABLE IssueLinks (
    Id UNIQUEIDENTIFIER PRIMARY KEY,
    ParentIssueId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL,
    ChildIssueId UNIQUEIDENTIFIER NOT NULL, 
    LinkType NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'Duplicate', 'Related', 'Blocks'
    ConfidenceScore DECIMAL(3,2), -- For auto-detected links
    CreatedBy NVARCHAR(450),
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
    CreatedBySystem BIT DEFAULT 0,
    TenantId NVARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
);
```
