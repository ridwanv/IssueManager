# Story 4.5: Agent Chat Interface for Issue Communication

## Status
**Approved**

## Story
**As a** support agent,  
**I want** to view and interact with the conversation that led to an issue creation directly from the issue details page,  
**so that** I can understand the full context and communicate directly with the reporter via the existing chat interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Issue details page includes a "Conversation" tab showing the original conversation that led to the issue creation
2. Conversation view displays the complete message history between the user and bot/system
3. Agent can send messages directly to the reporter through the chat interface when the conversation is active
4. Real-time updates show new messages from the reporter in the conversation tab
5. Agent presence is indicated to show when an agent is viewing/responding to the conversation
6. Chat interface maintains the same functionality and design as the existing ConversationDetail page

- Parameters: `ConversationDetailsDto ConversationDetails`, `EventCallback<string> OnMessageSent`, `bool SendingMessage`
- Handle different conversation modes (Active, Escalating, etc.)

**MudBlazor Tab Integration**:
- Use `MudTabs` with `MudTabPanel` components for issue details and conversation [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Implement `@bind-ActivePanelIndex` for tab state management with lazy loading
- Add responsive design for mobile/tablet tab navigation

**IssueConversationTabComponent.razor Template**:
```razor
@inject IMediator Mediator
@inject ISnackbar Snackbar
@inject SignalRConnectionService SignalRService
@inject IStringLocalizer<ConversationDetail> L
@implements IAsyncDisposable

<div class="issue-conversation-tab">
    @if (loading)
    {
        <div class="d-flex justify-center align-center" style="height: 400px;">
            <MudProgressCircular Color="Color.Primary" Indeterminate="true" Size="Size.Large" />
        </div>
    }
    else if (conversationDetails != null)
    {
        <ConversationMessagesComponent ConversationDetails="@conversationDetails" 
                                       CustomerTyping="@_customerTyping" />
        <ConversationInteractionComponent ConversationDetails="@conversationDetails"
                                          OnMessageSent="HandleNewMessage"
                                          SendingMessage="@_sendingMessage" />
    }
    else
    {
        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-center justify-center" style="height: 400px;">
            <MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Filled.ChatBubbleOutline" Style="font-size: 3rem; opacity: 0.3;" />
            <MudText Typo="Typo.body1" Color="Color.Secondary" Class="mt-2">
                No conversation linked to this issue
            </MudText>

### Technical Constraints

**Database Access Pattern (CRITICAL)**:
- **ALWAYS use `IApplicationDbContextFactory` for database access** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]
- Use comprehensive `.Include()` statements for conversation relationship loading [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]

**Multi-Tenant Isolation (CRITICAL)**:
- All conversation queries must include tenant filtering via `IUserContextAccessor` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]
- Ensure issue-conversation relationship respects tenant boundaries [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]

**Permission Checks**:
- Use `[Authorize(Policy = Permissions.Issues.View)]` for issue access [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]
- Use `[Authorize(Policy = Permissions.Conversations.View)]` for conversation access [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]
- Check both permissions when accessing issue conversation tab [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]

**SignalR Real-Time Updates**:
- Reuse existing SignalRConnectionService for connection management [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:643]
- Implement dual group membership (issue group + conversation group) for targeted updates [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:675]
- Handle connection state management and graceful reconnection [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:690-710]

**Component Reusability & Extraction Benefits**:
- Extract conversation message display and agent interaction into reusable components [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor]
- Both ConversationDetail page and IssueConversationTab will use the same extracted components
- Eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent conversation behavior across contexts
- Component parameters allow context-specific customization while maintaining core functionality
- Future conversation features automatically benefit both standalone and issue-embedded views
- Maintains single source of truth for conversation styling and SignalR event handlers [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:638-933]

### Performance Considerations

**Lazy Loading Strategy**:
- Only load conversation data when "Conversation" tab is activated [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Implement `OnParametersSetAsync` with tab change detection for efficient loading [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use caching for conversation data to avoid repeated queries [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**SignalR Optimization**:
- Use targeted SignalR groups to limit broadcast scope [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:675]
- Implement debounced updates for typing indicators [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:767-784]
- Optimize payload size for real-time messages [Source: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/ConversationDetail.razor:712-739]

### Architecture Alignment

**Clean Architecture Compliance**:
- UI layer communicates with Application layer via MediatR only [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Reuse existing conversation queries and commands without duplication [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Maintain separation of concerns between issue and conversation domains [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**Component Integration**:
- Follow existing tab component patterns in the application [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Maintain responsive design principles for mobile and desktop [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Preserve accessibility features in tab navigation [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
