@inject IDialogService DialogService
@inject IPermissionService PermissionService
@inject IStringLocalizer<Issues> L
@inject NavigationManager Navigation
@implements IAsyncDisposable
```
[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]

**MudBlazor Integration Components**:
- Use `MudSelect<IssueStatus>` for status dropdown with workflow validation [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Use `MudSelect<IssuePriority>` with color-coded priority indicators [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Use `MudAutocomplete<ApplicationUser>` for staff assignment [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Use `MudTextField` with validation for internal notes [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Use `MudTimeline` for audit trail display [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]

### Technical Constraints

**Database Access Pattern (CRITICAL)**:
- **ALWAYS use `IApplicationDbContextFactory` for database access** [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]
- Use `await using var db = await _dbContextFactory.CreateAsync(ct);` pattern [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]
- Use comprehensive `.Include()` statements for related data loading [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#database-access-pattern]

**Multi-Tenant Isolation (CRITICAL)**:
- All queries must include tenant filtering via `ITenantService` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]
- Use `ITenantService.GetCurrentTenant()` for automatic tenant context [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]
- Apply tenant filtering to InternalNote entity access [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#tenant-isolation]

**Domain Events and Audit Trail**:
- Use domain events for Issue status changes, assignments, and priority updates [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#domain-entity-example]
- Automatically create EventLog entries through domain event handlers [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#eventlog]
- Track all changes with Old/New values for complete audit trail [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#eventlog]

**Permission Checks**:
- Use `[Authorize(Policy = Permissions.Issues.View)]` on page level [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]
- Use `[MustHavePermission(Permissions.Issues.Edit)]` for update operations [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]
- Check permissions in components with `IPermissionService.HasPermissionAsync` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#permission-checks]

**SignalR Real-Time Updates**:
- Initialize SignalR connection in `OnInitializedAsync()` [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Implement connection groups for targeted updates to detail page viewers [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Handle connection state management and graceful reconnection [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Performance Considerations

**Database Query Optimization**:
- Use `ProjectTo<IssueDetailDto>()` for efficient data mapping [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Implement strategic `.Include()` statements to avoid N+1 queries [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use `.AsSplitQuery()` for complex includes with multiple collections [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache issue details with `ICacheableRequest<T>` pattern [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Invalidate cache on updates using `ICacheInvalidatorRequest<T>` [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Use `IssueCacheKey` pattern from existing implementation [Source: docs/stories/2.1.story.md]

**Real-Time Performance**:
- Use SignalR connection groups to limit broadcast scope [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Implement debounced updates to prevent excessive broadcasts [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Optimize payload size for SignalR messages [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

### Architecture Alignment

**Clean Architecture Compliance**:
- UI layer communicates with Application layer via MediatR only [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Domain entities contain business logic for status transitions and assignments [Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#domain-entity-example]
- Infrastructure handles external concerns like SignalR and database access [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**MudBlazor Integration**:
- Use Material Design principles for consistent UI design [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Leverage accessibility features in form controls [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]
- Follow MudBlazor theming and layout patterns [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ui-component-library]

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/2.2-issue-detail-view-management.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.2-risk-20250904.md (if needed)
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.2-nfr-20250904.md (if needed)

**Gate Decision Rationale:** Solid foundation with excellent backend implementation, but UI layer incomplete. Medium-severity issues with missing interactive components prevent PASS gate until ACs 2-5 are fully implemented with proper UI interactions.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

**Priority Actions:**
1. **High**: Complete interactive UI components (status dropdown, priority management, assignment interface, notes section)
2. **Medium**: Expand test coverage with comprehensive command handler and component tests  
3. **Low**: Consider implementing IUserLookupService for clean AssignedUserName mapping

**Refactored Files:**
- `src/Server.UI/Components/Issues/IssueAssignmentComponent.razor` - Fixed async method warning and improved performance
- `src/Server.UI/Pages/Issues/Details.razor` - Added performance optimization framework for event log refresh

**Ask Dev to Update File List:** Yes - two files were refactored during review with performance improvements

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → docs/qa/gates/2.2-issue-detail-view-management.yml
Quality score: 85/100 - High quality implementation with minor test coverage gaps
Evidence: All 6 ACs verified functional, comprehensive architecture compliance confirmed

**Gate Decision Rationale:** Substantial improvement from previous CONCERNS status. All interactive UI components are now fully implemented and functional. Backend architecture is exemplary. Only remaining issues are test coverage expansion (medium priority) and future enhancements that don't block current functionality.

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Done**

**Outstanding items are all low/medium priority enhancements:**
1. **Medium**: Expand test coverage for production confidence (not blocking for current functionality)
2. **Low**: Performance optimizations for selective refresh (future enhancement)
3. **Low**: IUserLookupService implementation (architectural improvement, not requirement)
