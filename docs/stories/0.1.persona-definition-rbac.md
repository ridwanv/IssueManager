# Story 0.1: Migrate from UserType Enum to Role-Based Access Control

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** to migrate from the current UserType enum approach to system-wide ASP.NET Core Identity roles,
**so that** the system uses proper role-based access control where role definitions are shared across tenants but role assignments are tenant-isolated.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **UserType Enum Removed**: Remove UserType enum and property from ApplicationUser, replace with role-based approach
2. **System-Wide Roles Defined**: Create global ApplicationRole entities (TenantId = null) matching current UserType personas  
3. **Migration Strategy Implemented**: Existing users with UserType values are migrated to appropriate role assignments
4. **Role-Based Authorization**: Update all permission checks to use roles instead of UserType enum
5. **Tenant-Isolated Assignments**: Ensure role assignments respect tenant boundaries while roles are globally defined
6. **UI Updates**: Update user management interfaces to use role assignment instead of UserType selection
7. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure system continues working during and after migration

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create Role Constants and Definitions (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create RoleConstants class with tenant-scoped role names matching UserType values
  - [x] Document role descriptions and permissions for each role

## Dev Notes

### Current System Analysis
[Source: Current codebase analysis]
- **Current Approach**: Uses `UserType` enum property on `ApplicationUser` entity 
- **Target Approach**: Standard ASP.NET Core Identity roles with `ApplicationRole` entities
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Role framework already exists but UserType enum overrides it
- **Migration Required**: Existing users need UserType values converted to role assignments

### Current UserType Enum Values
[Source: src/Domain/Enums/UserType.cs]
```csharp
public enum UserType
{
    PlatformOwner = 1,     // Platform super admin with cross-tenant access
    TenantOwner = 2,       // Tenant administrator with full tenant management
    IssueManager = 3,      // Manages issues and assigns work within tenant
    IssueAssignee = 4,     // Works on assigned issues and updates status
    ChatAgent = 5,         // Handles escalated customer conversations
    ChatSupervisor = 6,    // Supervises chat agents and handles escalations
    EndUser = 7,           // Basic user with limited system access
    ApiConsumer = 8        // External system integration access
}
```

### Target Role Structure
**Current Roles** (incorrectly tenant-scoped, should be global):
- **Admin** - Administrator role (currently exists, needs TenantId = null)
- **Basic** - Basic user role (currently exists, needs TenantId = null) 
- **Users** - Users role (currently exists, needs TenantId = null)

**New System-Wide Roles Needed** (TenantId = null):
- **PlatformOwner** - Platform super admin with cross-tenant access
- **TenantOwner** - Tenant administrator with full tenant management  
- **IssueManager** - Manages issues and assigns work within tenant
- **IssueAssignee** - Works on assigned issues and updates status
- **ChatAgent** - Handles escalated customer conversations
- **ChatSupervisor** - Supervises chat agents and handles escalations
- **EndUser** - Basic user with limited system access (replace existing Basic)
- **ApiConsumer** - External system integration access

**Key Design Principle**: 
- **Role definitions are global** (TenantId = null) 
- **Role assignments are tenant-aware** via user's TenantId context

### Current Identity Infrastructure Issues
[Source: src/Domain/Identity/ analysis]
- **ApplicationUser**: Has UserType property that needs removal
- **ApplicationRole**: Has `TenantId` property - should allow null for global roles ⚠️
- **ApplicationUserRole**: Junction table for many-to-many user-role relationships ✅
- **MultiTenantUserStore**: Incorrectly filters roles by tenant (line 120) ❌  
- **MultiTenantUserManager**: Incorrectly assumes all roles are tenant-scoped ❌
- **Role Services**: `IRoleService`, `RoleService` need updates for global roles
- **Existing Roles**: Only `Admin`, `Basic`, `Users` currently defined, all incorrectly tenant-scoped

### **Required Infrastructure Changes**:
1. **Allow Global Roles**: Modify role lookup to handle TenantId = null
2. **Update MultiTenantUserStore**: Support both global and tenant-scoped roles
3. **Fix Role Filtering**: Only filter user assignments by tenant, not role definitions

### Migration Strategy
**Phase 1: Role Creation**
- Create role constants matching UserType enum values
- Seed tenant-scoped roles in database
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

**Phase 2: Data Migration** 
- Create migration script to read UserType from existing users
- Assign appropriate roles based on UserType value and tenant
- Validate migration results before proceeding

**Phase 3: Code Updates**
- Replace UserType-based authorization with role-based checks
- Update UI components to manage roles instead of UserType
- Remove UserType property and enum after validation

**Phase 4: Cleanup**
- Remove UserType enum and related code
- Update tests to use role-based assertions
- Verify all authorization paths use roles

### Authorization Update Requirements
[Source: Current authorization usage analysis needed]
- **UserType-based Checks**: Need to identify all code using `user.UserType` for authorization
- **Permission Integration**: Ensure role-based permissions work with existing permission framework
- **UI Authorization**: Update Blazor components using UserType-based authorization
- **API Authorization**: Update controllers using UserType-based authorization

### File Locations for Changes
[Source: Clean Architecture structure]
- **Role Constants**: `src/Application/Common/Constants/Roles/RoleName.cs` (extend existing)
- **Migration**: `src/Migrators/Migrators.*/Migrations/` (UserType to roles migration)
- **User Service**: `src/Infrastructure/Services/Identity/UserService.cs` (role assignment logic)
- **Authorization**: `src/Application/Common/Security/` (role-based authorization)
- **UI Components**: `src/Server.UI/Components/Identity/` (role management components)
- **Multi-Tenant Services**: Already exist and handle tenant-scoped roles correctly

### Migration Implementation Details
**Database Migration Steps:**
1. **Pre-Migration**: Create all tenant-scoped roles in AspNetRoles table
2. **Data Migration**: For each user with UserType, assign corresponding role based on tenant
3. **Validation**: Verify all users have appropriate role assignments
4. **Schema Migration**: Remove UserType property from ApplicationUser table
5. **Post-Migration**: Validate system functionality with role-based approach

**Role Naming Convention:**
- Use simple names matching UserType enum: `PlatformOwner`, `TenantOwner`, `IssueManager`
- All roles are **global** with `TenantId = null` 
- Tenant isolation achieved through user assignment context, not role duplication
- Follow existing pattern: `Admin`, `Basic`, `Users` (simple names)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Existing test structure]
- **Unit Tests**: Test role assignment logic and authorization checks
- **Integration Tests**: Test database migration and role queries with tenant filtering
- **UI Tests**: Test role management interfaces and authorization in Blazor components
- **API Tests**: Test role-based authorization in controllers and endpoints

### Backward Compatibility Strategy
**During Migration:**
- Keep UserType property temporarily with [Obsolete] attribute
- Dual authorization checks (UserType OR roles) during transition period
- Logging to verify role-based authorization works correctly
- Rollback capability if issues are discovered

**Post-Migration:**
- Remove UserType property and enum completely
- Update all tests to use role-based assertions  
- Clean up obsolete authorization code
- Update documentation to reflect role-based approach

### Implementation Priority for Migration
1. **Role Constants** - Create RoleConstants class with standardized role names
2. **Database Migration** - Convert UserType values to role assignments
3. **Authorization Updates** - Replace UserType checks with role checks
4. **UI Updates** - Modify user management to use roles
5. **Testing** - Validate role-based functionality
6. **Cleanup** - Remove UserType enum and related code

### Key Implementation Considerations
**Role Assignment Strategy:**
- Users can have multiple roles (same role definitions available to all tenants)
- **Role definitions are global** with `ApplicationRole.TenantId = null`
- **Role assignments are tenant-isolated** via user's TenantId context
- Platform roles (like `PlatformOwner`) work across tenants naturally
- **MultiTenant services need updates** to support global role definitions

**Performance Considerations:**
- Role queries should be optimized with proper indexing
- User role caching to minimize database lookups
- Efficient tenant filtering for role-based queries
- Consider role hierarchy for permission inheritance

**Security Considerations:**
- Prevent privilege escalation through role manipulation
- Audit all role assignment changes
- Validate tenant context for all role operations
- Secure role assignment APIs with proper authorization

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
- Fixed Blazor syntax error in EscalationToast.razor (line 21) - converted complex Style binding to method call
- Resolved LINQ extension method issue in RoleBasedAuthorizationTests.cs by adding System.Linq namespace
- Updated multi-tenant role queries to support both global (TenantId = null) and tenant-scoped roles for backward compatibility

### Completion Notes
1. **Global Role Architecture**: Implemented global roles (TenantId = null) while maintaining backward compatibility with tenant-scoped legacy roles
2. **Data Migration Strategy**: Created comprehensive UserType-to-roles migration in ApplicationDbContextInitializer without requiring EF migrations
3. **Permission Mapping**: Mapped persona-specific permissions to roles for fine-grained authorization control
4. **UI Compatibility**: UserForm component already supported role assignment - only needed to update role filtering logic
5. **Multi-Tenant Support**: Updated MultiTenantUserManager and MultiTenantUserStore to handle both global and tenant-scoped roles
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Marked UserType as obsolete rather than removing to maintain compilation during migration period
