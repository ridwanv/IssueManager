# Story 6.3: My Conversations & Past Conversations Management

**Status**: Ready for Review  
**Epic**: User Experience and Navigation Enhancement  
**Assigned Agent**: dev  

## Story

**As a** logged-in customer service agent,  
**I want** a dedicated "My Conversations" page that shows only active/open conversations where I am currently assigned as the agent, and a separate "Past Conversations" page for conversations I have closed,  
**so that** I can focus on my current workload without distraction while still having access to my conversation history for reference and follow-up.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **My Conversations Filtering**: Modify existing "My Conversations" page to show only conversations where:
   - The conversation status is Active or Escalated (not Completed/Abandoned/Archived)
   - The logged-in agent is assigned as CurrentAgentId or ResolvedByAgentId
   - Display conversations using card-based layout instead of table for improved UX

2. **Past Conversations Menu Item**: Add new "Past Conversations" menu item under CONVERSATIONS section in MenuService

3. **Past Conversations Page**: Create new page at `/agent/past-conversations` showing conversations where:
   - The conversation status is Completed, Abandoned, or Archived  
   - The logged-in agent was the CurrentAgentId or ResolvedByAgentId when closed
   - Use enhanced table layout optimized for historical data review and analysis

4. **UI Layout Specification**: 
   - **My Conversations**: Replace table layout with responsive card layout including conversation summary, visual status indicators, priority badges, and quick action buttons
   - **Past Conversations**: Use enhanced table layout with sortable columns, advanced filtering, and bulk action capabilities optimized for historical data analysis

5. **Agent-Specific Filtering**: Both pages must enforce agent-specific filtering by:
   - Using current user's identity to filter conversations
   - Ensuring tenant isolation is maintained
   - Only showing conversations where the agent was actively involved

6. **Search and Filtering**: Maintain existing search functionality and add status filters appropriate to each page:
   - My Conversations: Filter by Active/Escalated status and priority
   - Past Conversations: Filter by resolution category and completion date range

7. **Navigation Updates**: Update MenuService to reflect the new Past Conversations option positioned after My Conversations

8. **Real-time Updates**: Ensure SignalR integration moves conversations between pages as status changes occur

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 6.1 successfully reorganized Issues menu structure, following similar pattern for CONVERSATIONS section organization
- Story 6.2 implemented comprehensive analytics with SignalR integration - reuse SignalR patterns for real-time conversation updates
- Existing MyConversations.razor already has search functionality and basic filtering that can be enhanced

### Data Models
**Conversation Entity** (Existing): [Source: src/Domain/Entities/Conversation.cs]
- Conversation.CurrentAgentId: String identifier for currently assigned agent
- Conversation.ResolvedByAgentId: String identifier for agent who closed the conversation  
- Conversation.Status: ConversationStatus enum (Active, Escalated, Completed, Abandoned, Archived)
- Conversation.Mode: ConversationMode enum (Bot, Human, Escalating)
- Conversation.Priority: Integer priority level (1=Standard, 2=High, 3=Critical)
- Conversation.ResolutionCategory: Resolution categorization for completed conversations
- Conversation.MessageCount: Total messages in conversation for card display
- Conversation.Duration: Calculated property for conversation length
- Conversation.CompletedAt: DateTime for completion filtering
- Conversation.TenantId: Multi-tenant isolation (critical for security)

**ConversationDTO Structure**: [Source: src/Application/Features/Conversations/DTOs/]
- Must include agent assignment fields for filtering
- Include conversation metadata for card display
- Support for status and resolution category filtering

### API Specifications
**Query Handlers**: Follow CQRS pattern with MediatR [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#CQRS Implementation]
- GetMyActiveConversationsQuery: Returns conversations where CurrentAgentId matches logged-in user AND status is Active/Escalated
- GetMyPastConversationsQuery: Returns conversations where (CurrentAgentId OR ResolvedByAgentId) matches logged-in user AND status is Completed/Abandoned/Archived
- Both queries must include tenant filtering and pagination support
- Use `IApplicationDbContextFactory` for database access (critical pattern) [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Agent Identity Access**: Use ASP.NET Core Identity context [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Access current user ID via HttpContext or injected ICurrentUserService
- Ensure agent filtering is applied at query level for security
- Never rely on client-side filtering for agent-specific data

### Component Specifications
**UI Components**: Follow MudBlazor component patterns [Source: architecture/components.md#Blazor Server UI Layer]
- ConversationCard.razor: Reusable card component for My Conversations page
- PastConversationsTable.razor: Enhanced table component with MudDataGrid for historical data
- Use MudCard with appropriate elevation and spacing for cards
- Use MudDataGrid with sorting, filtering, and pagination for Past Conversations table
- Include MudChip for status indicators and MudBadge for priority in both layouts

**Page Layout**: [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Follow existing MyConversations.razor page structure and styling
- Use MudContainer with MaxWidth.ExtraExtraLarge for consistency
- Maintain existing search bar and filter components
- Add page-specific filters (active status for My Conversations, completion date for Past Conversations)

**Navigation Integration**: [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- MenuService.cs location: src/Server.UI/Services/Navigation/MenuService.cs
- Add Past Conversations menu item in CONVERSATIONS section
- Use Icons.Material.Filled.History for Past Conversations icon
- Maintain existing permission structure (no role restrictions)

### File Locations
**New Page Component**: src/Server.UI/Pages/Agent/PastConversations.razor [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**UI Components**: 
- src/Server.UI/Components/Conversations/ConversationCard.razor (for My Conversations)
- src/Server.UI/Components/Conversations/PastConversationsTable.razor (for Past Conversations)
**Query Handlers**: 
- src/Application/Features/Conversations/Queries/GetMyActiveConversations/
- src/Application/Features/Conversations/Queries/GetMyPastConversations/
**Navigation Service**: src/Server.UI/Services/Navigation/MenuService.cs (modify existing)

### Testing Requirements
**Component Testing**: Use bUnit for Blazor component testing [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test ConversationCard component rendering with various conversation states
- Test PastConversationsTable component with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Test responsive behavior of card grid layout
- Test search and filter functionality on both pages

**Integration Testing**: Test query handlers and agent filtering [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test GetMyActiveConversationsQuery filters correctly by agent and status  
- Test GetMyPastConversationsQuery includes both CurrentAgentId and ResolvedByAgentId filtering
- Verify tenant isolation is maintained across all queries
- Test pagination and search functionality

**E2E Testing**: Use Playwright for end-to-end scenarios [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test navigation between My Conversations and Past Conversations pages
- Test real-time conversation movement between pages via SignalR
- Test agent-specific conversation visibility and security

### Technical Constraints
**Security**: Agent-specific filtering must be enforced at database level [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Never trust client-side filtering for agent data isolation
- Use ICurrentUserService or similar to get authenticated agent ID
- Apply agent filtering in query handlers, not in UI components

**Performance**: UI components must support pagination [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Performance Requirements]
- Card layout: Implement virtual scrolling for large conversation lists if needed
- Table layout: Use MudDataGrid's built-in pagination and server-side data loading
- Use FusionCache for conversation data caching with appropriate TTL
- Optimize rendering performance for both card and table layouts

**Multi-tenant**: All queries must respect tenant isolation [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#Multi-tenancy]
- Include TenantId filtering in all conversation queries
- Ensure agent assignment filtering works within tenant context
- Use established tenant service patterns

**Real-time**: SignalR integration for conversation status updates [Source: architecture/components.md#SignalR Integration]
- Listen for conversation status change events
- Automatically move conversations between My/Past pages
- Handle connection management and error recovery

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: Unit tests in `tests/Server.UI.Tests/Pages/Agent/` and `tests/Application.UnitTests/Features/Conversations/Queries/`
- **Testing Framework**: Use bUnit for Blazor components, xUnit for backend handlers
- **Test Requirements**: 
  - Agent filtering accuracy tests (security critical)
  - Card component rendering tests across device sizes
  - Navigation and routing tests
  - SignalR real-time update tests
  - Multi-tenant isolation validation tests
