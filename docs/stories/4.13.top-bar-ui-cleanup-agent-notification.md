# Story 4.13: Top Bar UI Cleanup and Agent Notification Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** support agent using the Issue Manager dashboard,
**I want** a cleaner top bar interface with relevant controls and a new notification indicator next to the agent status,
**so that** I can focus on essential functionality and be immediately alerted when new messages arrive from customers, including which user sent the message and the ability to click to navigate directly to their conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove language selector from the top bar interface
2. Remove GitHub integration controls from the top bar interface  
3. Remove left-to-right text direction controls from the top bar interface
4. Add a notification indicator component next to the agent status display
5. Notification indicator shows a visual badge when new messages arrive
6. **ENHANCED**: Display a message icon that visually represents the notification functionality
7. **ENHANCED**: Implement blinking animation for unacknowledged notifications
8. Notification tooltip/popup displays the username/contact who sent the message
9. Clicking on the notification navigates directly to the relevant conversation
10. Notification system integrates with existing SignalR real-time updates
11. Notification state persists until user acknowledges or views the conversation
12. Multiple notifications are properly managed (show count, list recent senders)
13. **ENHANCED**: Only show notifications for conversations assigned to the specific agent

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on Story 4.12 (Agent Notification System for Message Handoff), the notification infrastructure is already established with SignalR hub integration and API endpoints for agent notifications. This story builds upon that foundation to provide the UI components.

### Source Tree Information [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Layout Components**: Located in `src/Server.UI/Components/Layout/`
- **Main Layout File**: `src/Server.UI/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor`
- **Navigation Components**: `src/Server.UI/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor`
- **SignalR Hub**: `src/Server.UI/Hubs/NotificationHub.cs`
- **SignalR Service**: `src/Server.UI/Services/SignalR/SignalRConnectionService.cs` (existing)
- **Static Assets**: `src/Server.UI/wwwroot/css/` for styling updates

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- **Component Structure**: Follow standard Blazor Server component pattern
- **MudBlazor Integration**: Use MudBlazor components for consistent UI design
- **SignalR Connection**: Use existing `SignalRConnectionService` for real-time updates
- **Navigation**: Use `NavigationManager` for programmatic navigation
- **Component Lifecycle**: Implement `IAsyncDisposable` for proper cleanup

### Technical Implementation Details [Source: architecture/components.md]
- **Real-time Updates**: Use existing `SignalRConnectionService` instead of direct HubConnection
- **Service Injection**: Inject `SignalRConnectionService` via `@inject` directive
- **State Management**: Use Blazor Server built-in state management
- **UI Framework**: MudBlazor 7.0+ with Material Design components
- **Navigation**: ASP.NET Core routing with Blazor page components

### API Integration [Source: Story 4.12 context]
- **Notification Endpoint**: `/api/conversations/{conversationId}/notify-agent` (already implemented)
- **Notification Models**: `AgentNotificationRequest` and `NotificationUrgency` models available
- **Error Handling**: Use Result<T> pattern for consistent API responses

### Testing
- **Component Testing**: Use bUnit framework for Blazor component isolation testing
- **Integration Testing**: Test SignalR real-time notification delivery
- **End-to-End Testing**: Use Playwright .NET for browser-based notification testing
- **Test Location**: `tests/Server.UI.Tests/Components/Layout/` for component tests

Test Requirements:
- Unit tests for NotificationIndicator component rendering and state management
- Integration tests for SignalRConnectionService notification delivery
- End-to-end tests for notification click navigation workflows
- Responsive design testing across multiple screen sizes
- Mock SignalRConnectionService for component unit tests

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework**: Blazor Server (.NET 9.0) with real-time SignalR integration
- **UI Library**: MudBlazor 7.0+ for consistent Material Design components
- **State Management**: Built-in Blazor Server state with SignalR updates
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with SignalR compatibility

### Security Considerations [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Permission Checks**: Use `IPermissionService` for notification access validation
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure notifications are filtered by tenant context
- **Cross-User Privacy**: Prevent notification leakage between different user sessions
