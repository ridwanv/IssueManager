# Story 4.13: Top Bar UI Cleanup and Agent Notification Enhancement

## Status
In Progress (Hardening & Real-Time Reliability Enhancements)

## Story
**As a** support agent using the Issue Manager dashboard,
**I want** a cleaner top bar interface with relevant controls and a new notification indicator next to the agent status,
**so that** I can focus on essential functionality and be immediately alerted when new messages arrive from customers, including which user sent the message and the ability to click to navigate directly to their conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Remove language selector from the top bar interface
2. Remove GitHub integration controls from the top bar interface  
3. Remove left-to-right text direction controls from the top bar interface
4. Add a notification indicator component next to the agent status display
5. Notification indicator shows a visual badge when new messages arrive
6. **ENHANCED**: Display a message icon that visually represents the notification functionality
7. **ENHANCED**: Implement blinking animation for unacknowledged notifications
8. Notification tooltip/popup displays the username/contact who sent the message
9. Clicking on the notification navigates directly to the relevant conversation
10. Notification system integrates with existing SignalR real-time updates
11. Notification state persists until user acknowledges or views the conversation
12. Multiple notifications are properly managed (show count, list recent senders)
13. **ENHANCED**: Only show notifications for conversations assigned to the specific agent
14. **ENHANCEMENT**: Notifications are grouped by conversation, showing only the latest message per conversation
15. **ENHANCEMENT**: Badge displays conversation count rather than total message count for better scalability
16. **ENHANCEMENT**: Only customer messages trigger notifications (agent responses and system messages are filtered out)
17. **ENHANCEMENT**: Individual conversations show unread message count when multiple messages are pending
18. **ENHANCEMENT**: Single click on conversation notification marks all messages as read and navigates to conversation

### Post-Implementation Defect Fix (Real-Time Notification Persistence)
_Documenting remediation already applied prior to hardening tasks._

- [x] **Task 5.1: Root Cause Isolation & Stability Patch**
  - [x] Identified two root causes for missing notifications after navigation: (1) conversation components leaving SignalR groups on dispose, (2) broad `HubConnection.Remove("Handler")` calls in `ConversationDetail` removing handlers owned by `NotificationIndicator`.
  - [x] Replaced direct `HubConnection.Remove(...)` calls with scoped per-handler `IDisposable` registrations inside `ConversationDetail` so disposal is localized.
  - [x] Stopped issuing `LeaveConversationGroup` on component/page dispose; groups now persist until a `ConversationCompleted` event (ensures off-page notifications).
  - [x] Validated off-page notification delivery (navigate away → send test message/escalation → badge increments correctly).
  - [x] Added tolerant parsing for dual message payload formats (DTO + generic object) preventing silent handler failures.
  - [x] Introduced temporary structured logging markers (Join / HandlerRegistered / HandlerInvoked) to aid verification.
  - [ ] Convert temporary logs to standardized EventIds (captured in Task 10).

### Hardening & Reliability Follow-Up (Post Initial Acceptance Scope)

These tasks extend Story 4.13 to address resilience, architectural cleanliness, and prevention of regression for real‑time notifications discovered during investigative debugging after initial implementation.

- [ ] **Task 6: Centralize Conversation Group Management**
  - [ ] Define `IConversationGroupService` abstraction
  - [ ] Implement `ConversationGroupService` (singleton) with:
    - In‑memory tracking of joined conversation group IDs (thread-safe)
    - `EnsureJoinedAsync(conversationId)` (idempotent)
    - `LeaveIfMarkedCompletedAsync(conversationId)` / `LeaveAsync` (only on completion or explicit release)
    - `RejoinAllAsync()` for reconnection scenarios
    - Logging (Join, AlreadyJoined, Rejoin, Leave, SkipLeave)
  - [ ] Register in DI (Singleton) and integrate with existing `SignalRConnectionService`
  - [ ] Migrate `NotificationIndicator.razor` to use service (remove local `_joinedGroups` state)
  - [ ] Replace direct `HubConnection.Remove(...)` usage with scoped `IDisposable` handler registrations
  - [ ] (Optional) Prepare future adoption in `ConversationDetail` / other components (no premature group leave)

- [ ] **Task 7: Reconnection Resilience & Event Lifecycle**
  - [ ] Add handler for `HubConnection.Reconnected` / `Closed` → invoke `ConversationGroupService.RejoinAllAsync()`
  - [ ] Add exponential backoff retry for join failures (log warnings)
  - [ ] Add structured log scope `ConversationGroups` for correlation
  - [ ] Surface minimal UI diagnostic (dev mode only) to show: connection state, joined group count

- [ ] **Task 8: Event Stream Consolidation & Legacy Cleanup**
  - [ ] Audit dual message event handlers (`NewMessageReceived` DTO + object fallback + legacy `NewConversationMessage`)
  - [ ] Remove legacy / fallback handler once DTO path validated across browsers (retain structured logging proof)
  - [ ] Consolidate escalation and completion events semantics (consistent payload shape)
  - [ ] Remove temporary test endpoints (`test-notification`, `test-escalation`) or guard behind `IHostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()`
  - [ ] Update documentation (real‑time flow diagram + handler lifecycle policy)

- [ ] **Task 9: Automated Testing & Regression Shielding**
  - [ ] Unit tests: `ConversationGroupService` (idempotent joins, rejoin after simulated disconnect, leave-on-completion)
  - [ ] bUnit component test: `NotificationIndicator` reconnection scenario (simulate dropped connection → rejoin + notification received)
  - [ ] Integration test: Assigned conversation event triggers join then message appears as notification
  - [ ] Load test (lightweight) simulating N (e.g., 25) concurrent conversation assignments → ensure service set size accuracy
  - [ ] Snapshot test for notification list rendering (multiple senders, blinking badge state)

- [ ] **Task 10: Observability & Logging Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add structured log events (EventIds) for Join/Leave/Rejoin/HandlerRegistered/HandlerDisposed
  - [ ] Add debug toggle (appsettings.Development.json) to enable verbose SignalR trace forwarding
  - [ ] (Optional) Add minimal `/diagnostics/realtime` Razor page gated by role/ENV

- [ ] **Task 11: Documentation Updates**
  - [ ] Update Story 4.13 acceptance appendix with resilience considerations
  - [ ] Add architecture note: "Real-Time Group Membership Lifecycle" (diagram) under `docs/architecture/components.md`
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section (symptoms: missing notifications after navigation; causes; verification steps)

---

### Extended Acceptance Criteria (Supplemental)
14. Group membership is centralized and idempotent (no duplicate join calls).
15. A reconnection automatically restores all previously joined conversation groups within < 2 seconds (under normal network conditions).
16. No component issues a broad `HubConnection.Remove(handlerName)` that unintentionally deregisters global handlers.
17. Legacy / duplicate message event handlers are eliminated or clearly flagged behind a development-only path.
18. Unit and component tests enforce notification persistence across navigation + reconnection.
19. Diagnostic logging allows tracing a notification from message event → group membership confirmation → UI badge increment.
20. Group leave only occurs after conversation completion (or explicit administrative release), never merely on navigation away.

### Risk Mitigations
- Central service prevents accidental premature `LeaveConversationGroup` calls.
- Scoped disposables eliminate broad handler removal side effects.
- Rejoin pathway covers transient network blips and app restarts.
- Tests codify regression barriers for future refactors.

### Out-of-Scope (Deferred)
- Persistent (database) storage of joined groups across server restarts (current in-memory acceptable for session scope)
- Cross-tab synchronization for multi-browser-agent setup
- Full real-time analytics dashboard (basic diagnostics only in this iteration)
