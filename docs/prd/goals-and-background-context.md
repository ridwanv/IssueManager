# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Reduce issue resolution time by 50% through automated triage and structured workflows
- Eliminate manual data entry overhead saving 2-4 hours per day of support staff time
- Achieve 40-60% automated resolution rate for common, repetitive issues
- Improve issue tracking accuracy to 95%+ with automated capture replacing Excel
- Maintain familiar WhatsApp user experience while adding professional backend capabilities
- Transform reactive support into data-driven, proactive service operations

## Background Context

The organization currently manages application and portal issues through an informal WhatsApp group where users report problems, support staff manually capture details into Excel spreadsheets, and resolutions are communicated back through the group. This manual process creates significant bottlenecks: duplicate data entry increases processing time and introduces errors, lack of structured categorization makes tracking difficult, and Excel-based management provides no real-time visibility or automated workflows.

The growing volume of applications and users makes this manual approach increasingly unsustainable, risking longer resolution times and decreased service quality. The proposed WhatsApp Issue Management System leverages the familiar communication channel while introducing professional support operations, AI-powered automated solutions, and comprehensive tracking capabilities built on the existing Clean Architecture .NET 9 foundation.
