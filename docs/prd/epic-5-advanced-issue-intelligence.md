# Epic 5: Advanced Issue Intelligence & Deduplication

**Epic Goal:** Enhance the issue management system with AI-powered intelligence capabilities to automatically detect, link, and deduplicate similar issues, providing superior user experience through contextual awareness and reducing duplicate investigation efforts for support teams.

## Story 5.1: Intelligent Issue Linking and Deduplication

As a **support staff member**,
I want **the system to automatically detect and link similar issues when they are reported**,
so that **I can reduce duplicate investigation efforts and provide better context-aware responses to users about known issues**.

### Acceptance Criteria

#### OpenAI-Powered Similarity Detection
1. Implement OpenAI-based semantic similarity comparison service with configurable confidence thresholds
2. Configure similarity detection timeframe window (default: 7 days, 80% confidence threshold)
3. Create intelligent prompts for issue comparison that handle context, nuances, and technical language
4. Support multilingual comparison (English/Afrikaans) with proper context understanding
5. Include category, priority, and product context in comprehensive similarity analysis

#### Database Schema Enhancement
6. Create IssueLink entity for managing parent-child and sibling relationship types between issues
7. Add database indices for performance optimization on similarity queries
8. Include link metadata (auto/manual creation, confidence score, created by user, timestamp)
9. Support bulk linking operations and relationship management

#### Bot Integration Enhancement  
10. Modify WhatsApp bot issue creation flow to automatically check for similar existing issues
11. Generate contextual bot responses when similar issues are found, informing users of investigation status
12. Include estimated resolution timeframe information if available from linked parent issues
13. Log all similarity detection and automatic linking actions for audit purposes

#### Issue Management UI Enhancement
14. Display comprehensive linked issues section on issue details page showing all relationships
15. Show impact summary with affected users count, individual descriptions, and relationship types
16. Implement intuitive link/unlink actions with proper confirmation dialogs and validation
17. Provide manual issue linking capabilities for support staff with search and selection interface

#### Bulk Resolution Communication
18. When parent issue is resolved, automatically notify all linked issue reporters via WhatsApp
19. Include resolution details and specific instructions relevant to each user's reported variation
20. Support customizable notification templates for different types of issue relationships
21. Track notification delivery status and user acknowledgment for compliance purposes

#### Advanced Analytics and Reporting
22. Generate issue clustering reports showing frequently linked categories and patterns
23. Provide similarity detection accuracy metrics and confidence score analytics
24. Display deduplication impact metrics (time saved, reduced investigation effort)
25. Create trending analysis for issue types with high similarity patterns

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with Azure OpenAI Service for semantic similarity analysis
- Multilingual support with proper language detection and context preservation
- Real-time similarity checking during issue creation workflow
- Performance optimization for large issue databases with indexed similarity queries
- Comprehensive audit logging for all AI-driven decisions and manual overrides

### Business Value
- Reduce duplicate issue investigation effort by 30-40%
- Improve user communication about known issues and resolution status
- Better understanding of issue impact scope and affected user base
- Streamlined resolution notifications for widespread issues affecting multiple users
- Enhanced support team efficiency through intelligent issue relationship management
