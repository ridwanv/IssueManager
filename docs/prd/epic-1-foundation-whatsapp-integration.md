2. Basic health check and ping response functionality operational 
3. Authentication and security middleware configured for webhook validation
4. Logging and monitoring infrastructure established for bot operations
5. Development and testing environment configuration documented
6. CI/CD pipeline extended to include Bot project deployment

## Story 1.2: WhatsApp Business API Integration

As a **system administrator**,
I want **to integrate with WhatsApp Business API and handle incoming messages**,
so that **users can initiate conversations with the support bot**.

2. Incoming message parsing and validation with error handling for malformed messages
3. Basic message acknowledgment sent to users upon successful receipt
4. Message routing logic to distinguish between new issues and ongoing conversations
5. Rate limiting and API quota management implemented
6. Webhook security validation using WhatsApp signature verification

## Story 1.3: Conversational Issue Intake Flow

As an **end user**,
I want **to report issues through a guided WhatsApp conversation**,
so that **I can provide structured information without learning complex forms**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Bot initiates friendly greeting and explains issue reporting process
2. Guided prompts collect application name, issue category, description, and urgency level
3. Input validation with helpful error messages for incomplete or unclear responses
4. Confirmation summary showing captured information before final submission
5. User can modify any field during the conversation flow
6. Conversation state maintained across multiple message exchanges with timeout handling

## Story 1.4: Basic Issue Entity Creation

As a **support staff member**,
I want **issues submitted via WhatsApp to be automatically created in the system**,
so that **I no longer need to manually transfer information from group messages to Excel**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Issue entities created with all captured information (application, category, description, urgency)
2. Unique issue identifiers generated and returned to users for reference
3. Initial issue status set to "New" with timestamp and user contact information
4. Integration with existing multi-tenant architecture for proper data isolation
5. WhatsApp conversation metadata stored for audit trail and follow-up communication
6. Error handling for database failures with graceful user notification
