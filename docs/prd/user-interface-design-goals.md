# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create a professional, efficient support dashboard that feels familiar to support staff while maintaining the conversational, approachable WhatsApp experience users expect. The web interface should prioritize speed and clarity for high-volume issue processing, while the WhatsApp chatbot should feel natural and helpful, guiding users through structured information gathering without feeling robotic or bureaucratic.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface:** WhatsApp bot uses natural language with guided prompts, validation, and friendly confirmations
- **Dashboard-Centric Workflow:** Support staff work primarily from a centralized web dashboard with real-time updates and efficient task management
- **Status-Driven Communication:** Automated WhatsApp notifications keep users informed without requiring active dashboard monitoring
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex information revealed gradually in both interfaces to avoid overwhelming users

## Core Screens and Views
- **WhatsApp Conversation Flow:** Issue intake, solution presentation, status updates, resolution confirmation
- **Issue Management Dashboard:** Main list view with filters, search, and bulk operations
- **Issue Detail View:** Complete issue information with history, notes, and response interface  
- **Analytics Overview:** Basic metrics dashboard for volume, performance, and team workload
- **User Management:** Support staff assignment, permissions, and notification preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure web dashboard meets WCAG AA standards for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios. WhatsApp interface inherently accessible through platform's built-in accessibility features.

## Branding
Align with existing organizational branding using current color palette and design tokens from the Clean Architecture Blazor template. Maintain professional, trustworthy appearance that reinforces service quality expectations.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web dashboard optimized for desktop/laptop use by support staff with responsive design for mobile/tablet access when needed. WhatsApp integration works across all mobile platforms and WhatsApp Web for desktop users.
