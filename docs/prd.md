# WhatsApp Issue Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Reduce issue resolution time by 50% through automated triage and structured workflows
- Eliminate manual data entry overhead saving 2-4 hours per day of support staff time
- Achieve 40-60% automated resolution rate for common, repetitive issues
- Improve issue tracking accuracy to 95%+ with automated capture replacing Excel
- Maintain familiar WhatsApp user experience while adding professional backend capabilities
- Transform reactive support into data-driven, proactive service operations

### Background Context

The organization currently manages application and portal issues through an informal WhatsApp group where users report problems, support staff manually capture details into Excel spreadsheets, and resolutions are communicated back through the group. This manual process creates significant bottlenecks: duplicate data entry increases processing time and introduces errors, lack of structured categorization makes tracking difficult, and Excel-based management provides no real-time visibility or automated workflows.

The growing volume of applications and users makes this manual approach increasingly unsustainable, risking longer resolution times and decreased service quality. The proposed WhatsApp Issue Management System leverages the familiar communication channel while introducing professional support operations, AI-powered automated solutions, and comprehensive tracking capabilities built on the existing Clean Architecture .NET 9 foundation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a professional, efficient support dashboard that feels familiar to support staff while maintaining the conversational, approachable WhatsApp experience users expect. The web interface should prioritize speed and clarity for high-volume issue processing, while the WhatsApp chatbot should feel natural and helpful, guiding users through structured information gathering without feeling robotic or bureaucratic.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Interface:** WhatsApp bot uses natural language with guided prompts, validation, and friendly confirmations
- **Dashboard-Centric Workflow:** Support staff work primarily from a centralized web dashboard with real-time updates and efficient task management
- **Status-Driven Communication:** Automated WhatsApp notifications keep users informed without requiring active dashboard monitoring
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Complex information revealed gradually in both interfaces to avoid overwhelming users

### Core Screens and Views
- **WhatsApp Conversation Flow:** Issue intake, solution presentation, status updates, resolution confirmation
- **Issue Management Dashboard:** Main list view with filters, search, and bulk operations
- **Issue Detail View:** Complete issue information with history, notes, and response interface  
- **Analytics Overview:** Basic metrics dashboard for volume, performance, and team workload
- **User Management:** Support staff assignment, permissions, and notification preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Ensure web dashboard meets WCAG AA standards for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios. WhatsApp interface inherently accessible through platform's built-in accessibility features.

### Branding
Align with existing organizational branding using current color palette and design tokens from the Clean Architecture Blazor template. Maintain professional, trustworthy appearance that reinforces service quality expectations.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Web dashboard optimized for desktop/laptop use by support staff with responsive design for mobile/tablet access when needed. WhatsApp integration works across all mobile platforms and WhatsApp Web for desktop users.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Continue with existing monorepo structure, extending current Clean Architecture foundation with new WhatsApp integration components in the existing src/Bot/ project and enhancing current Domain entities (Issue, Attachment, EventLog).

### Service Architecture
**Monolithic Clean Architecture** - Build upon existing .NET 9 Clean Architecture foundation with clear separation of concerns:

- Extend existing migration projects (Migrators.MSSQL, Migrators.PostgreSQL, Migrators.SqLite) for new entities
- Utilize existing ApplicationDbContextFactory pattern for all new database operations

**Authentication & Security:**
- Integrate with existing ASP.NET Core Identity system and multi-tenant architecture
- Leverage current permission-based authorization system for support staff access control
- Extend existing audit logging capabilities for WhatsApp communication tracking

**Communication & Integration:**
- WhatsApp Business API via webhook integration (Azure Communication Services or approved third-party provider)
- SignalR for real-time dashboard updates using existing infrastructure
- Extend existing IMailService pattern to create IWhatsAppService for message handling

**Development & Deployment:**
