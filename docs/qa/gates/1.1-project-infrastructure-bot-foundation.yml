# Specific recommendations for immediate and future action
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Create BotControllerTests.cs with webhook POST/GET endpoint tests"

    - action: "Create WhatsAppSignatureVerificationMiddlewareTests.cs covering security scenarios"
      refs: ["src/Bot/Middleware/WhatsAppSignatureVerificationMiddleware.cs"]
    - action: "Add health check integration tests to validate monitoring endpoints"
      refs: ["src/Bot/Controllers/BotController.cs:134-156"]
  future:
    - action: "Address build warnings in IssueIntakePlugin nullable annotations"
      refs: ["src/Bot/Plugins/IssueIntakePlugin.cs:25-32"]
    - action: "Consider extracting webhook configuration constants to separate class"
      refs: ["src/Bot/appsettings.json:10-17"]

# Code quality assessment summary
notes: |
  This is a well-architected Bot service foundation with excellent security practices and clean code structure. 
  The namespace consistency issues have been resolved during review. The primary concern is the complete absence 
  of automated tests for critical webhook endpoints and security middleware, which creates risk for production 
  deployment. The implementation itself is production-ready from functionality and security perspectives.
