## 1. Overview

This document captures the current state of the boilerplate application prior to enhancement. It provides a baseline for technical planning, risk assessment, and future integration.

---


## 2. Solution Structure

- **Tech Stack:** .NET (C#), Azure Bot Service, Bot Framework, Blazor Server (MudBlazor UI)
- **Project Layout:**
  - `src/` — Application, Bot, Domain, Infrastructure projects
  - `Server.UI/` — Blazor Server UI layer (see Section 3A)
  - `tests/` — Unit and integration tests
  - `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile` — Containerization support

---

## 3A. UI Layer (Server.UI) — Current State

- **Framework:** Blazor Server with MudBlazor component library
- **Structure:**
  - `Components/` — Reusable UI components (forms, dialogs, autocompletes, shared layout)
  - `Pages/` — Razor pages for app features (Dashboard, Contacts, Documents, Products, Identity, SystemManagement, Tenants, Public)
  - `wwwroot/` — Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
  - `Themes/` — Theming and style customization
- **Current Dashboard:**
  - Displays placeholder financial widgets, tables, and sample charts unrelated to issue intake
  - No WhatsApp, issue, or triage features present
- **Navigation:**
  - Menu and layouts are generic, not tailored to the WhatsApp Issue Intake Service
- **Missing Features:**
  - No pages/components for WhatsApp issue submission, triage console, analytics, or deduplication
  - No integration with backend APIs for issue data
  - No real-time updates or notifications for new issues

---

---

## 3. Key Components

- **Bot Adapter:** Handles incoming messages and errors
- **Program/Startup:** Configures services, dependency injection, and middleware
- **Domain Layer:** Entities, value objects, enums, and events
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Persistence, external service integrations, configurations
- **Application Layer:** Features, pipelines, resources, and DI

---

## 4. Data Persistence

- **Database:** Not yet fully implemented; boilerplate may include EF Core setup
- **Migrations:** Check for presence of migration scripts or tools
- **Blob Storage:** Not configured by default

---

## 5. API Endpoints

- **Bot Endpoint:** `/api/messages` (default for Bot Framework)
- **Other APIs:** Not present in base template

---

## 6. Security & Observability

- **Authentication:** Not enabled by default
- **Logging:** Basic logging via Bot Framework; no advanced observability
- **Secrets:** No Key Vault integration in base

---

## 7. Technical Debt & Constraints

- No domain-specific models or business logic
- No WhatsApp integration or LLM extraction
- No persistence or analytics features
- Minimal test coverage
- No CI/CD or infrastructure as code

---

## 8. Risks

- Significant gaps between boilerplate and target architecture
- Need for new adapters, data models, and security hardening
- Integration complexity for WhatsApp, LLM, and Azure services

---


## 9. Recommendations

- **Backend:**
  - Establish baseline with current code
  - Incrementally add adapters, persistence, and analytics
  - Prioritize security and observability from the start

- **UI Layer:**
  - Replace placeholder dashboard with widgets and tables for issue intake, triage, and analytics
  - Add pages/components for:
    - WhatsApp issue submission (for demo/testing)
    - Issue list, detail, deduplication, and search (console for Ops Analysts)
    - Analytics dashboard (automation rate, latency, dedupe precision, etc.)
  - Integrate with backend APIs for real data (issue intake, status, attachments, etc.)
  - Update navigation and layouts to reflect the new product focus
  - Add real-time updates/notifications for new issues

---

---

## 10. Next Steps

- Use this analysis to inform PRD refinement and architectural planning
- Begin enhancement with clear milestones and risk mitigation
