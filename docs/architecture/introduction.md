# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the **Issue Management System**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

The architecture builds upon a proven Clean Architecture Blazor template, extending it with specialized WhatsApp intake capabilities, AI-powered bot integration, and comprehensive security analysis features.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

This Issue Management System is built on a **Clean Architecture Blazor template** (.NET 9) and uses Blazor Server. The project extends this template with specialized features for WhatsApp integration and AI-powered bot capabilities.

**Analysis:**
- **Base Template:** Clean Architecture Blazor template (.NET 9)
- **Architecture Pattern:** Clean Architecture with Domain/Application/Infrastructure/UI layers
- **Existing Features:** Multi-tenancy, ASP.NET Core Identity, SignalR, Entity Framework
- **Extensions:** WhatsApp Bot integration, AI services (Semantic Kernel), Security analysis
- **Database Support:** MSSQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite via multiple migrator projects

**Constraints Imposed:**
- Must maintain Clean Architecture layering principles
- Cannot modify core template structure significantly
- Must work with existing Entity Framework setup
- Should integrate with established CQRS/MediatR patterns
- Must support existing multi-database configuration
