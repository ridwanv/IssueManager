# SaaS Multi-Tenant Conversion - Product Requirements Document

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Convert existing shared-database multi-tenant system to true SaaS with database-per-tenant isolation
- Add self-service tenant provisioning and subscription management
- Implement automated billing and usage tracking
- Maintain existing Clean Architecture foundation and WhatsApp integration capabilities
- Enable white-label and reseller partnerships
- Support 1,000+ tenant organizations with high performance and security

### Background Context
The current IssueManager system uses a shared database with tenant isolation via TenantId filtering. While this works for controlled environments, true SaaS requires stronger tenant isolation, self-service onboarding, subscription management, and billing automation. The existing Clean Architecture foundation and multi-tenant infrastructure provide a solid base for SaaS conversion.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** Self-service tenant registration with automated database provisioning and schema deployment
**FR2:** Subscription management with multiple pricing tiers (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
**FR3:** Automated billing integration with usage-based pricing and subscription lifecycle management
**FR4:** Tenant-specific custom domains and white-label branding capabilities
**FR5:** Master admin portal for SaaS operations, tenant management, and system monitoring
**FR6:** Automated tenant database backup, restore, and migration capabilities
**FR7:** Usage analytics and billing metrics per tenant with API rate limiting
**FR8:** Multi-region deployment support with tenant geo-location preferences
**FR9:** Tenant data export/import for migration and compliance requirements
**FR10:** Integration marketplace for third-party services and custom tenant configurations

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** Database provisioning must complete within 60 seconds for new tenant registration
**NFR2:** System must support 1,000+ active tenants with 99.9% uptime SLA
**NFR3:** Tenant isolation must be complete with no cross-tenant data access possible
**NFR4:** Billing and subscription changes must be reflected in real-time
**NFR5:** Master database performance must remain optimal with high tenant volumes
**NFR6:** Data compliance with GDPR, SOC2, and regional data residency requirements
**NFR7:** Automated scaling for tenant databases based on usage patterns
**NFR8:** Disaster recovery with RPO < 1 hour and RTO < 4 hours per tenant
