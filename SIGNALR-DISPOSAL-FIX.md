# SignalR Connection Disposal Fix

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing the error: **"Real-time updates unavailable: Cannot access a disposed object. Object name: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection'. Using polling mode."**

This error occurred when:
1. SignalR connections were disposed during page navigation or circuit restarts
2. Components tried to access the disposed HubConnection
3. The system would fallback to polling mode, causing degraded performance

## Root Cause Analysis

### Service Lifetime Issue
- `SignalRConnectionService` was registered as **Scoped** instead of **Singleton**
- Scoped services get disposed when Blazor circuits restart (page navigation, browser refresh)
- But SignalR connections should persist across page navigations within the same browser session

### Connection State Management
- Components didn't properly check if the connection was disposed before using it
- No safe wrapper methods for SignalR invocations
- Race conditions between disposal and connection usage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Service Lifetime (DependencyInjection.cs)
```csharp
// Before: Scoped - disposed on circuit restart
services.AddScoped<SignalRConnectionService>();

// After: Singleton - persists for application lifetime
services.AddSingleton<SignalRConnectionService>();
```

### 2. Enhanced SignalRConnectionService
Added the following improvements:

#### Disposal State Tracking
```csharp
private volatile bool _isDisposed = false;

public bool IsConnected => _hubConnection?.State == HubConnectionState.Connected && !_isDisposed;
```

#### Safe Invocation Method
```csharp
public async Task<bool> TryInvokeAsync(string methodName, params object[] args)
{
    if (_isDisposed || _hubConnection == null)
        return false;

    try
    {
        if (_hubConnection.State == HubConnectionState.Connected)
        {
            await _hubConnection.InvokeAsync(methodName, args);
            return true;
        }
    }
    catch (ObjectDisposedException)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning("Attempted to invoke {MethodName} on disposed SignalR connection", methodName);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, "Error invoking {MethodName} on SignalR connection", methodName);
    }

    return false;
}
```

#### Better Connection Recovery
- Dispose existing connections before creating new ones
- Reset connection task on failures to allow retries
- Improved error handling and logging

### 3. Updated Components to Use Safe Methods

#### AgentDashboard.razor
```csharp
// Before: Direct unsafe invocation
await _hubConnection.InvokeAsync("JoinAgentGroup");

// After: Safe invocation with error handling
var success = await SignalRConnectionService.TryInvokeAsync("JoinAgentGroup");
if (!success)
{
    _connectionStatus = "Failed to join agent group";
    StartPollingMode();
}
```

#### Specific ObjectDisposedException Handling
```csharp
catch (ObjectDisposedException ex)
{
    var errorMessage = "Cannot access a disposed object. Object name: 'Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR.Client.HubConnection'";
    _connectionStatus = $"Failed: Connection disposed";
    Snackbar.Add($"Real-time updates unavailable: {errorMessage}. Using polling mode.", Severity.Info);
    StartPollingMode();
}
```

### 4. Updated Other Components
- **NotificationIndicator.razor**: Safe group join/leave operations
- **EscalationIndicator.razor**: Safe escalation acceptance/ignore operations
- **Other components**: Updated to use `SignalRService.IsConnected` and `TryInvokeAsync`

## Benefits

### 1. Eliminated Disposal Errors
- No more "Cannot access a disposed object" errors
- Graceful fallback to polling mode when SignalR unavailable

### 2. Better Connection Persistence
- SignalR connections now persist across page navigations
- Reduced connection overhead and improved user experience

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Specific handling for ObjectDisposedException
- Safe invocation methods prevent crashes
- Better logging for debugging

### 4. Automatic Recovery
- System gracefully falls back to polling mode
- Users see clear status indicators
- Real-time features resume when connection restored

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Page Navigation**: Navigate between pages rapidly to test connection persistence
2. **Browser Refresh**: Refresh pages while real-time updates are active
3. **Network Issues**: Simulate network disconnections and reconnections
4. **Multiple Tabs**: Open multiple tabs and verify each maintains proper connection state
5. **Long Sessions**: Test with extended user sessions to verify no memory leaks

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages:
- `‚úÖ SignalR connection started successfully`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Attempted to invoke {MethodName} on disposed SignalR connection`
- `‚ùå Error invoking {MethodName} on SignalR connection`
- `üîÑ Real-time updates unavailable: {error}. Using polling mode.`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Connection Health Monitoring**: Periodic health checks
2. **Automatic Reconnection**: Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track connection success/failure rates
4. **User Notification**: Better visual indicators for connection state changes
